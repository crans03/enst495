The survey was conducted to gain a general idea regarding attitudes toward anti-consumption, obstacles to participating in anti-consumption, and how these factors might change as someone grows older. The interviews were conducted to gain further insight into the factors that play a role in different individuals’ attitudes towards anti-consumption.

The survey did not collect names or email addresses of respondents, and clarified this at multiple different points. 

The following are a list of questions asked by the survey: 
- Have you ever intentionally practiced anti-consumption or reduced your consumption of anything for environmental/ethical reasons?
        - *Yes*
        - *No*
- On a scale of 1-10, rate how much you care about the impact your consumption has on the environment. 
         - *1 – Don’t care at all*
         - *10 – I think about it all the time, every day*
- For you personally, what is the biggest obstacle to practicing more (or any) forms of anti-consumption?
    - *Practical inconvenience*
    - *High cost*
    - *Attachment to consumption – I just like stuff*
    - *Losing connection to other people – the culture I’m part of is built around consumption*
    - *I don’t care at all*
    - *Other*
- For people in general, what do you think the biggest obstacle to anti-consumption becoming more popular is?
    - *Practical inconvenience*
    - *High cost*
    - *Attachment to consumption – people just like stuff*
    - *Losing connection to other people – our culture is built around consumption*
    - *They don’t care at all*
    - *Other*
- On a scale of 1-10, rate your **current** motivation to practice any form of anti-consumption.
    - *1 – No motivation*
    - *10 – I’m already doing it and have no plans to stop*
- On a scale of 1-10, rate your motivation to practice any form of anti-consumption at any point in the next 10 years.
    - *1 – No motivation*
    - *100% doing it*
- If your perceived future motivation to practice anti-consumption was higher than your current motivation, what do you think will change?
    - *I’ll just care more*
    - *I’ll have more money to spend*
    - *I’ll have more free time*
    - *I’ll have a more stable lifestyle*
    - *I’ll spend more time around other people who might care about anti-consumption*
- If at all, how annoyed do you get when people encourage you to reduce your consumption of something for environmental/ethical reasons?
    - *1 – I’ve never been annoyed by this*
    - *10 – I get angry*
- Do you think you’re less likely to practice any form of anti-consumption the more you’re encouraged/told to do it?
    - *Yes*
    - *No*
- Assuming you're a university student, what year are you?
    - *Undergraduate student*
    - *Graduate student*
    - *Graduated university within last 5 years and NOT a graduate student*
    - *I'm not a current university student or recent (last 5 years) grad*
- Is/was your undergraduate major Environmental Studies, Environmental Science and Health, or a close equivalent?
    - *Yes*
    - *No*

During my time at university, I’ve noticed that there are significant differences between the stage of life people expect to be at even five years after graduating vs. 10 years after. In particular, it seems as if people expect to have a relatively similar lifestyle for five or six years after graduating – as a young professional – before beginning to ‘settle down’ in life towards 10 years after graduating. Consequently, I selected the timeframe of 10 years to measure future expected anti-consumption participation because I thought it would likely show greater differences with the present than shorter timeframes. As seen on the ‘Survey Results’ page, this seems to be true.

## PARAGRAPH START ##
I conducted six interviews, each approximately 15-20 minutes long. The shortest interview was 13 minutes and 40 seconds, while the longest was over 21 minutes. I recorded all interviews with the consent of the interviewees. 

All of the interviewees were people I have a personal connection with and have known for at least a year. Four of the interviewees were current university students, one graduated from university in the last five years, and one graduated over five years ago. 

Before each interview, I made sure the interviewee knew that their name was not going to be used in the project. I also clarified that the interviews are intended to be informal, so that the interviewees could feel comfortable expressing their honest opinions in any way they preferred. 

Due to the informal nature of the interviews, I didn’t follow a rigid structure, and the structure was slightly different for each interview. However, the questions I asked were generally similar to the following questions, in the same order: 

- Do you think anti-consumption efforts are annoying? Do you find people who promote them annoying? If so, why?
- Do you actually care at all about the impact your consumption has on the environment?
- Why do you think most anti consumption campaigns aren’t successful on a society-wide scale?
- If there’s a time in which you intentionally practice anti-consumption or reduced consumption of something, why were you able to do this specific form of anti-consumption? 
- I personally find anti-consumption efforts to be inspiring, but have at times felt like I was isolating myself when attempting to practice anti-consumption. Have you ever felt similarly?
- Do you think de-politicizing anti-consumption campaigns would be an effective way to make them more popular?
- Do you think centralizing anti-consumption campaigns purely around how they align with consumers’ self-interests would be effective?
