Project Overview and Goal
## HEADING END ##

## PARAGRAPH START ##
This website was created for my final project in the ENST495: Senior Seminar in Environmental Studies course at the University of Southern California. **The goal of the project is to explore the nuances in university students‚Äô attitudes towards anti-consumption** as a general concept.

What is Anti-Consumption?
## HEADING END ##

## PARAGRAPH START ##
On a broad level, anti-consumption is a philosophy that emphasizes critically analyzing one‚Äôs material needs and minimizing their consumption of *all* material goods. In practice, anti-consumption often manifests itself in the form of reducing consumption of or avoiding *certain types of* material goods. This is largely due to financial, time, and logistical constraints that make it difficult or impossible for many people to pay specific attention to their consumption of all material goods simultaneously. 

Anti-consumption practices can be focused on any type of material good. There is also a significant range of magnitudes of anti-consumption practices: for example, avoiding the purchase of food packaging for one meal a week and avoiding the purchase of food packaging at all times are both forms of anti-consumption, despite the significant difference in difficulty and impact of the two practices. This project considers any and all anti-consumption actions, regardless of the good at hand or difficulty of the practice.

Examples

## PARAGRAPH START ##
Some more examples of anti-consumption practices include avoiding ‚Äòfast fashion‚Äô clothing, living a zero-waste lifestyle, repair cafes, voluntary simplicity, the slow food movement, and diets that avoid meat, for example. Each of these practices can be performed to a small or great extent. 

An example of a shop with a business model that encourages a form of anti-consumption is SUAY in Los Angeles, which manufactures all of its clothing using only second-hand fabrics, and thus requires no new material to be used (SUAY, n.d.).

Anti-Consumption Within Broader Environmental Efforts
## SUBHEADING END ##

## PARAGRAPH START ##
Though various environmental movements have existed for many decades, the last 15 years have seen a heightened attention placed on society‚Äôs relationship with the earth, largely due to the worsening impacts and clearer-than-ever understanding of anthropogenic climate change. This has resulted in particular focus being placed on how the consumption habits of everyday people contribute to climate change. At the very least now, many people are simply aware of the fact that their consumption is connected to climate change ‚Äì and that greater consumption means greater impact. 

Consequently, this has given rise to the idea of anti-consumption, and perhaps more widely, a sentiment of anti-consumption. 
The implications and importance of anti-consumption and related concepts ‚Äì such as green consumerism and voluntary simplicity ‚Äì are hotly contested. On one side, proponents suggest that the concepts lay the groundwork for a more sustainable society with a bottom-up approach, starting on the individual level. For example, green consumerism, which is the process of buying products that have allegedly been made in a more environmentally friendly way than typical comparable products (Baron, 2024), offers individuals a sustainable consumption-based alternative. 
Voluntary simplicity, in which participants simplify the role material goods play in their lives (Elgin & Mitchell, 1977, 2), also allows individuals to reduce their consumption impact. Anti-consumption practices do the same. 

In some ways, anti-consumption and voluntary simplicity avoid some of the biggest criticisms of green consumerism. For example, Dr. Gabriela Baron of the University of Auckland criticizes green consumerism for propagating the idea that we can ‚Äòconsume‚Äô our way out of the environmental challenges we face. Anti-consumption and voluntary simplicity fortunately don‚Äôt face this issue for the most part, as they discourage consumption altogether or encourage it only in specific contexts, respectively. Baron also suggests that another major drawback of green consumerism stems from our tendency to fall for greenwashing, which is the practice of falsely advertising a product as environmentally friendly. Green consumerism and voluntary simplicity both push consumers to buy only ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô products, though to different extents, and thus may inadvertently lead them towards greenwashed products. Anti-consumption avoids this issue altogether. 

However, and perhaps more importantly, Baron also suggests that a major fault with green consumerism is the fact that it places responsibility for the world‚Äôs environmental problems on individuals rather than large corporations and governments. This criticism, unlike the previous two, is highly relevant to anti-consumption, which seeks to slow global consumption with its bottom-up approach. Placing too much emphasis on individuals‚Äô actions may be related to the complex relationship between individuals and consumption this project explores, and will be discussed in greater detail in the Discussion and Analysis section.

Project Motivation
## HEADING END ##

## PARAGRAPH START ##
I was motivated to focus on the complex relationship we have with consumption and anti-consumption practices after noticing a disconnect between the enthusiasm and support frequently expressed by students for individual pro-environmental actions and the actual actions taken. I believed that listening to people without judgement ‚Äì and collecting anonymous data ‚Äì would be a good way to further investigate the complex relationships we as humans have with consumption, and the practical reasons as to why we do or don‚Äôt participate in anti-consumption efforts. 

I was particularly interested to focus on the emotional and practical aspects of our relationship to anti-consumption after having been exposed to various benefits and critiques of anti-consumption and similar contents in my ENST495 seminar class. Points from several of the articles that I found most intriguing are discussed on the Discussion and Analysis page.

Project Focus
## HEADING END ##

## PARAGRAPH START ##
This project focused primarily on current university students and relatively recent (within the last five years) university graduates because, as a university student myself, I‚Äôm surrounded primarily by other university students. This means that, in addition to having many potential subjects nearby, I‚Äôm able to better understand the experiences and attitudes of my subjects. Ideally, this should result in more insightful interview questions and analysis. 

However, for the sake of collecting as much data as possible, the data collection was not limited to current students and recent graduates. Several of the survey respondents were significantly older than university-age or recent-graduate age as well as one of the interviewees (who also filled out the survey).

I also sought to focus primarily (but not exclusively) on students who aren‚Äôt majoring in Environmental Studies or something similar, as I believed they would provide a more representative sample of the greater student population.

Data Collection Process

## PARAGRAPH START ##
Data was collected through an anonymous survey and six informal interviews. The ‚ÄòSurvey and Interview Process‚Äô page of this website provides more detail regarding the specific questions asked in and rationale behind the survey and interviews.
