## PARAGRAPH START ## 
- All interviewees stated that they do genuinely care about the impact of their consumption on the environment and working conditions
- Several interviewees emphasized that people are generally selfish and won’t do a pro-environment action unless it's easy for them, even if they’re aware of the urgency of the related environmental issue
- Several interviewees framed a lack of anti-consumption action slightly differently and emphasized the logistical, time, and financial challenges that can be associated with changing one’s lifestyle to adhere to anti-consumption principles, even if the change can save them time or money in the long run
2 interviewees mentioned that they don’t 
- When discussing specific anti-consumption actions that they’ve successfully taken, 5 interviewees mentioned actions that were financially beneficial to them. Of these five, four specifically mentioned buying fewer or only used clothing, and one mentioned significantly reducing his consumption of red meat. 
- 5 interviewees noted that they are significantly influenced by the actions of the people around them, and that they’re more likely to partake if others are already or simultaneously doing a certain anti-consumption action 
- More specifically, multiple interviewees mentioned that being the only one in a social setting or social group doing a certain anti-consumption action can feel isolating and make the action seem pointless and insignificant 
- All interviewees agreed that depoliticizing the promotion of anti-consumption (i.e., through removing key words with strong political associations) would be an effective way to make anti-consumption more popular among people who are currently ideologically opposed to the concept
- Furthermore, 5 interviewees agreed that focusing anti-consumption campaigns exclusively on how they align with individuals’ self interest would be the most effective way to make anti-consumption practices more popular. An example of this would be focusing EV marketing on how much money people can save on gas with no mention of the zero operational emissions of EVs. 
- **It was generally agreed upon that showing people how they can save money by engaging in anti-consumption is the best way to convince people to partake in anti-consumption**

Surprises
## HEADING END ##

## PARAGRAPH START ## 
- Multiple interviewees noted that they had never been encouraged or told to practice anti-consumption at any point in their lives. I was surprised by this as I expected that even non-Environmental Studies students would come across many posts encouraging anti-consumption on their social media and LinkedIn feeds, in YouTube videos, and news articles, which I’ve experienced for many years now. I likely underestimated the extent to which the prevalence of such posts in my own internet experience is a result of my own interest in environmental issues. 
- One interviewee stated that his likeness to undertake a specific anti-consumption action is not at all affected by the people around him, both negatively and positively.
- No interviewees said that they find people who promote anti-consumption to be outright annoying. Similarly, one interviewee stated that peer pressure regarding pro-environmental actions has a positive effect on him. I was surprised by this because I’ve heard numerous people express irritation with peer pressure in this context.
