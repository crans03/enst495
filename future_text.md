The findings of this project lay the foundation for numerous different future explorations of attitudes towards anti-consumption. The following are some potential ideas:

Multiple interviewees suggested that once a certain anti-consumption action reaches a critical mass of popularity, its popularity could explode enough so that it eventually becomes a social norm. I think it would be interesting to investigate what percentage of society people consider this critical mass to be. Similarly, I think it would be interesting to explore the percentages of society who partake in the action at which point non-participants would begin to partake themselves. 

It would be interesting to collect more data on the difference between current anti-consumption practices and expected future participation of respondents at several different points in the future, rather than only 10 years from now. This could reveal in more detail how people expect their consumption habits to change over time. 

It would also be valuable to track people’s anti-consumption efforts for years after they first fill out the survey, as this would allow us to compare their predicted participation at different points in time with their actual participation. This would provide insight into whether people expect greater future participation simply due to discounting their future time and actions, or whether people truly do become stronger participants as they grow older. 

All participants claimed to care about the impact of their consumption on the environment. Despite this genuine care, some respondents still seem to get bothered by people encouraging them to practice anti-consumption. Consequently, I’m intrigued to determine the manner in which these respondents would most prefer to be encouraged to practice anti-consumption.
