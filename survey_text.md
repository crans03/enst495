- The median and mode 1-10 ranking for how much respondents care about their impact on the environment is 6. The mean is 5.95. 
‘Practical inconvenience’ and ‘attachment to consumption’ were most commonly voted the biggest obstacle to participation in anti-consumption activities for individuals, with 36.4% of the vote for each. ‘Losing connecting to other people’ and ‘high cost’ both received 13.6% of the vote. ‘I don’t care at all’ received no votes.

For this question, ‘practical inconvenience’ received 40.9% of the vote while ‘attachment to consumption’ received 27.3%. ‘High cost’ received 13.6%, while ‘losing connection to other people’ and ‘they don’t care at all’ split the remaining vote with 9.1% each.

- The most popular reason as to why respondents have higher motivation to participate in anti-consumption in the future than now is because they expect to have a more stable lifestyle in 10 years. 65% of the 20 respondents to this question selected this as a relevant factor.
